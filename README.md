Welcome to Cruxata!
===================


Hey! **Cruxata** used to be an Online Web Game, developed with **PHP** and used [Codeigniter](http://codeigniter.com) as base framework. This was a personal project that I had online for a few years and I had to suspend due to lack of time.

After several years, I finally decided to **share the code**, and put it online so anyone can take a look at it. This was my first big personal project.

You're free to use all the code and images. The images were made by a Graphic Designer, who I paid to do them, so I own their license, but I'll allow anyone to use them, always keeping its credits. :)

Please feel free to clone the repository. If you know me, or have followed my work for some time now, you'll know that this isn't my first web based game. I also lead a **[community focused on an OGame clon](http://www.xgproyect.org/)**, when I've time.

**Important:** since it's being along time, and I don't intent to put time and effort in Cruxata's code anymore, I won't be providing any support. Anyone with basic programming skills should be able to put this code to work in no time. Also the DB file is attached here.

As a side note about the DB, it contains **production data**, email addresses were replaced by a dummy, and all passwords were reset to 12345 (sha-1).
